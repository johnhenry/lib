  <header>Standard Library</header>
  <p>This is my standard library.</p>
  <p>
    You can find the source code here at

    It's a collections of various modules, components, and applications that
    I've created over the years.
  </p>
  <p>
    By publishing them here, I hope that you'll use them in your projects too!
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="">/bash</a> contains useful utitlities that I use almost daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="">/css</a> contains useful CSS utilities. Some contain useful class
    that you can attach to html elements such as the "hide-n-show-landscape"
    module, which hides and shows elements at the right time. Other modules
    provide a univresal effect such as "universal-box-sizing" or
    "universal-unstyled-links". Still, other moduels provide useful variables
    such as the "colors-tango" library.
  </p>
  <p>
    All CSS modules are available in plain, uncompliled code and can be imported
    directly into any modern web application without modification.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="">/js</a> contains useful JavaScript utilities. Like the CSS
    modules, thes are coded in plain, uncompliled code and can be imported into
    directly into any modern web applicion <b>OR</b> used in a
    <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>
    application (depending upon whether or not the proper globals are
    available.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The documentation is non-existent at the moment; but you can see how to use
    some of the libraies by examing the source code of some of my apps. Check
    out the code for
    <a href="https://github.com/johnhenry/forsnaken">forsnaken</a>
    Additionally, I'm working on some <a href="./demos">demos</a> to demonstrate
    how they work.
  </p>
  <p>
    WARNING: This is very much still in flux. I'm in the process of organizing,
    documenting, and testing everyting. While I plan to version all modules
    eventually, modules versioned less thatn 1.0.0 are considered unstable and
    subject to change. Also, the indicies are not up to date, so
