## About

This is as collection of tools and components that
I have created.

By publishing them here, I also hope that you will be able to use them too!

Everything is written in uncompliled JavaScript and CSS
to make it easy to pull into your own projects.

No need to host your own infrastructure --
[`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\* projects into many hosted services
including:

- [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net)
- [codepen](http://codepen.io)
- [deno deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/) are using this library.

<small>\* If a service does not allow you to use the `import` keyword within its JavaScript panel, try using a script tag within the HTML.</small>

Pull in libraries hosted in other repositories including:

- [jspm](https://jspm.org/)
- [deno](https://deno.land/std) / [deno land x](https://deno.land/x)

Everything is still in the early stages,
but I'm working to make everything accessible to the average user!

I'll try not to break anything, but, but **UNTIL A MODULE'S VERSION IS 1.0.0 or greater, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED UNSTABLE**

(and nothing in this repo is there stable. See [consistency notes](./consistency) notes).
