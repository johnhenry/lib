tl;dr [skip straight to some demos](./demos.html)

## Site Map

- [search](./search.html) Search for modules
- [js](./js/) Index of useful importable JavaScript modules
- [css](./css/) Index of useful importable CSS modules
- [bash](./bash/) Index of useful Command Line Tools
- [html](./html/) Index of useful HTML snippets
- [demos](./demos.html) Demos using the above modules

This is my standard library.
It is a collection of modules, tools and components that
I've created for my personal projects over the years.
I hope that publishing them here, I will be able to easily pull them
into other projects that I create.

Most importantly, I also hope that you will be able to use them too!
Everything is still in the early stages,
but I'm working to make everything accessible to the average user!
This means adding documentation, a search function, and [more demos](./demos.html).

Everything is written in pure, uncompliled languages -- JavaScript and CSS.
This makes it easy to import them directly into your project -- web or [deno](https://deno.land/). I'm currently in the process of languages that compile to the web -- Typescript, Rust, and AssemblyScript are the prime candidates.

Keep in mind that this is still in the early stages. The code in all modules should be considered unstable unless versioned 1.0.0 or above. (No modules currently fit this criterion). If you want to search for something specific, you'll have a better time by visiting the [github repository](https://github.com/johnhenry/lib) directly.
