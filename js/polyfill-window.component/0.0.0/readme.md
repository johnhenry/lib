# Polyfill Window

> **This module now also lives at [`@johnhenry/domkit`](https://github.com/johnhenry/domkit)** (`@johnhenry/domkit/polyfill-window.component`), where active development continues. This copy is a frozen, working snapshot -- it stays published at this URL (per this repo's own no-deletion policy) but won't receive future fixes.


Dynamically imports a module and assigns its export to a key on
`globalThis` -- for loading a global polyfill declaratively from HTML,
rather than registering a custom element (compare
[define-component.component](../../define-component.component/0.0.0/readme.md),
which this module's own `demo.html` uses to bootstrap itself and which
solves the related "register a custom element from a URL" problem).

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Global key to assign the import to (required) |
| `src` | URL of the module to import, resolved relative to the current document (required) |
| `import` | Named export to assign. Defaults to the module's default export |
| `force` | If present, re-imports and re-assigns even if `globalThis[name]` is already set |
| `no-import` | If present, the module is imported (for its side effects) but nothing is assigned to `globalThis` |
