# Tester

/std/js/tester@latest/index.mjs

Tester is a javascript testing framework based on [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).

Like Tape, tester

- can be run directly using [node](https://nodejs.org) without any additional binaries or transformations.
- produces output using the standard [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/).

Unlike Tape, tester

- can be run directly in the browser or using [deno](https://deno.land) without any additional binaries/transformations,
  along with node.
- uses external assertions and makes it easy to write your own.

## API

Tester's API consist of two manin components:

- The "tester" function acts on a group of assertions.
- The assertions themselves, which return errors if a given condition is not satisfied.

### Tester

The tester function is the default export.

It takes as its only argument a [possibly asynchronous] generator. We call this a "test".

Results of assertions are yielded from within the body of a test.

```javascript
import tester from "./index.mjs";

tester(function* () {
  yield /*some assertion result*/;
  yield /*some other assertion result*/;
});
```

### Assertions

The named exports are assertions.

Call them within a test and yield their results.

```javascript
import tester, { ok, notok } from "./index.mjs";

tester(function* () {
  yield ok(true);
  yield notok(false);
});
```

#### Included Assertions

Besides ok and notok, there are a number of assertions included:

- ok -- test passes if and only if the given argument to a test is TRUTHY.
- notok -- test passes if and only if the given argument to a test is FALSH.
- equal -- test passes if and only if the two given arguments are THE SAME object.
- notequal -- test passes if and only if the two given arguments are NOT THE SAME object.
- pass -- test ALWAYS PASSES
- fail -- test ALWAYS FAILS
- subtestpass -- test passes if and only if the given argument is a test in which ALL THE ASSERTIONS PASS.
- subtestfail -- test passes if and only if the given argument is a test in which AT LEAST ONE ASSERTION FAILS.
- throws -- test passes if and only if the given function THROWS AN ERROR when called
- doesnotthrow -- test passes if and only if the given function DOES NOT THROW AN ERROR when called

### plan

When using the run function, the first argument passed to given generator is a function.
We'll call it "plan", but you can name it anyting you like ("expect", "assertions", etc.)
When _plan_ is called with an integer, it dictates the number of expected assertions in a given test function.

import tester, { ok } from "./index.mjs";

```javascript
tester(function* (plan) {
  plan(1);
  yield ok(true);
});
```

## Creating Assertions

When creating assertions, use the examples in _./assertions_ for inspiration.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Assertions are functions that test for a desired conditon.
- If the given conditions meet the desired conditions,
  - an accepted message is returned.
  - Otherwise, an instance of TestError is returned.

```javascript
import TestError from "./testerror.mjs";

const assertion = (/*given conditions*/)=>{
  if(/*conditions are met*/){
    return /*some message*/;
  }
  return new TestError(/*some message*/);
}
```

### Conventions

This library follows a specific convetion for its assertions.
It's recommended that you follow these conventions when creating your own assertions,
but feel free to come up with your own.

- The last item is an _operator string_, which is used for the TAP protocol and can be overridden.
- The next-to-last item is a _default expected message_ that can also be overridden.
- The preceeding arguments are given conditions to be tested.
- The returned TestError is constructed using the default expected message
  along with an object detailing the difference between what's expected and what's not.

```javascript
import TestError from "./testerror.mjs";

const assertion = (/*given conditions*/, message, operatorString)=>{
  if(/*conditions are met*/){
    return message;
  }
  return new TestError(message, /*some object*/));
}
```

### TestError API

The test error is constructed with two items:

- An expected messages
- An object who's key-value pairs are displayed as part of TAP output
