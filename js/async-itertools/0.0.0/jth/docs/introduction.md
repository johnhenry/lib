# Introduction

What better way to start learning a language than with...

## Hello World

This program:

```javascript
"Hello World" @!;
```

prints "Hello World" to the console.

Let's break it down into parts.

`"Hello World"` is the string that we want to print. Adding it to the line puts it on the stack.

The `@` operator is used to print the previous items on the stack.

(Note that `@` is syntactic sugar for the std/peek function.)

The `!` is use to apply a function at the top of the stack on the rest of the stack. It may be attached directly to a function that operates on the stack.

Finally, `;` the marks the end of the line.

## The stack

I mentioned "the stack" a before. It's simply an array represented by the current line.

Lets take a look at another example.

This program:

```javascript
"Hello World" "How are you today?" @!;
```

prints "How are you today?" to the console.

It didn't print "Hello World" because the `!`
only applies `@` to the item on top of the stack. To print the entire stack, we need to use the `!!` operator.

```javascript
"Hello World" "How are you today?" @!!;
```

Alternatively, if we want to print the last two items on the stack, we can specify a number:

```javascript
"Hello World" "How are you today?" @!{2};
```

### Storing

We can store the stack, or any part of it to a variable using `->` to use in stacks that follow.

This program:

```javascript
"Hello World" "How are you today?" @! -> [first, second];
second first @!!;
```

(Note that @ doesn't motify the stack, just displays it)

prints "How are you today? Hello world." to the console.

When storing the full stack, it's an array. Expand it with `.` to add it's values to the stack (remember to add the `!` operator).

```javascript
"Hello World" "How are you today?" @! -> stack;
stack @!; /* prints array */
stack .! @!!; /*prints individual items */
```

### Substacks

`[` and `]` can be used to denote a "substack" (or "subprogram" ).

This is an array whose items are immediately expanded into the stack. Functions applied within a substack are limited to the items within.

The following program:

```javascript
1 [2 3 @!!];
```

Prints "2 3" but not "1" as `@!!` is only applied within the substack.

Add a `.` immediately after a substack (no space) to prevent expansion.

```javascript
1 [2 3]. -> [scalar, array];
scalar @!; /* prints 1 */
array[1] @!; /* prints 3 */
```

## stack functions and composition.

As mentioned before, `!` applies a function to the stack before it.

These functions, "stack functions", take an array as an argument and return an array as an argument.

A number of standard [stack functions](./api.md#stack-functions) are available.

The easiet way to create functions is to create it in javascript:

```javascript
export const sum$ = (stack) => {
  return [stack.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1)];
};
export const dupe$ = (stack) => {
  return [stack.reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1)];
};
```

and import it into an jth file.

```javascript
import { sum$, dupe$ } from "...";
1 2 3 sum$! @!; /* prints 6 */
1 2 3 dupe$! @!; /* prints 1 2 3 3 */
```

You can also compose functions using `:`.

```javascript
import { sum$, dupe$ } from "...";
1 2 3 sum$! @!; /* prints 6 */
dupe$ product$ :!! -> [square$];
3 square$!; /* prints "9" */
```

## Javascript Compatibiltiy

### Imports/Exports

The syntax for importing and exporting objects is identical to that of javascript with two exceptions:

- lines must end with a semicolon.
- references to "jth" files are changed to "mjs" files during transformation.

### Expressions

Most expressions are compatible with javascript, but inculding spaces will generally cause an error. (working to fix) . Spaces witin quotes are fine.

Otherwise, feel free to use drop in javascript syntax where appropriate.

The following programs maps two random numbes to truth values and prints them.

```javascript
Math.random() Math.random() stack=>stack.map(x=>x>0.5?true:false) !! @!!;
```

### js code

Wrapping a line with `js{};` allows you to inject directly into a program.
Warning: EXPERIMENTAL

```javascript
js{for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)}
i @!;
js{}}
```
