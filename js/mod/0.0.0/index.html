<h1 id="mod">mod</h1>
<p>The modulus operator (%') in math works slightly differently than it does in javascript (%). That is in math, it's a binary operation that returns a positive number. In javascript, the number can be negative. This &quot;mod&quot; function works <em>more</em> like the math version.</p>
<p>mod = (a, b) =&gt; a %' b</p>
