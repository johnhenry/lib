# CSS Model

## M in MVC

Model View Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that separates functionality into three distinct parts:

- Model
- View
- Controller

CSSModel is a model for:

1. [declaratively] defining the behavior of
   certain CSS custom properties;
2. using those properties to create appications
   that are laregly unaware of
   underlying [imperative] Javascript.

## Usage

This is a base class and so,
you will not likely use it directly;
but rather a descendent.

constructors general take a element and will define
custom properties on that element to be
inherited by the element's children.
