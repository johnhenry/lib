# Consent Buddy

Consent buddy provides a mechanism to:

- accept a user's response to a request for consent and via prompt (via DOM events)
- handle said response (generically)
- handle visibility of said dialog (via css custom property)
- record and replay the response without re-promppting the user (via local storage)
